Each of the letter contains 4 rectangles, the round corners are fixed but most of the parameters are changable, such as x,y offset, width and height and rotation, although some rectangles may exclude certain parameters. The available and changeable parameters are shown below:

Red stroke rectangle:
  *`stroke1_posY` : x offset of the red stroke rectangle
  *`stroke1_width`: width of the red stroke rectangle
  *`stroke1_height`: height of the red stroke rectangle
  *`angle_set`: rotation of the red stroke rectangle
  
Yellow rectangle:  
  *`right_posX`: x offset of the yellow rectangle
  *`right_posY`: y offset of the yellow rectangle
  *`right_width`: width of the yellow rectangle
  *`right_height`: height of the yellow rectangle
  *`angle_set2`: rotation of the yellow rectangle

Brown stroke rectangle:
  *`topRectY`: y offset of the blue rectangle
  *`topWidth`: width of the blue rectangle
  *`topHeight`: height of the blue rectangle

Blue rectangle:
  *`stroke2_posX`: x offset of the brown stroke rectangle
  *`stroke2_posY`: y offset of the brown stroke rectangle
  *`stroke2_width`: width of the brown stroke rectangle
  *`stroke2_height`: height of the brown stroke rectangle
